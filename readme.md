General project idea and objectives:

IDEA
- To provide a more elegant and friendly website so people can see how many and which dogs are in the dog shelter of Évora, Portugal at each moment. This should show people the number and general stats about the dogs

OBJECTIVES
- show a general page with all the dogs with their photo and name
- have a detail page for each dog with general info (sex, day it entered at the shelter, age, race, etc) and all photos of that dog
- stats page with current statistics and historic data of the shelter


WEBSITE OUTLINE
- 1 home page with logo and links to other apps
- 3 apps: 
	.FocinhoBook (album of all dogs where people can select one to see more details)
	.Webcam view (when implemented, should give access to webcam and toys to be controlled remotely)
	.Stats

OTHER NICE THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
- login account (multiple or single?) just to volunteers so they can add photos of dogs
- routine to take user uploaded images and upload them to shelter's facebook/instagram/imgur repo and store them there and link to them there so they don't overload server. also see best way to show thumbnails without having to store smaller image
- get access to the municipal dog shelter database to get their data from there so there is no need to duplicate data (might be hard but its talkable)
- form to add email to mailing list that automatically shoots an email with the weekly news (dogs/cats in and out and other shelter related news)
- search function for cats/dogs' name
- new app with dogs/cats out and where they are
